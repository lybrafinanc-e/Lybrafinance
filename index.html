For bridging, the focus is on user driven asset movement between chains. Although this sounds like an intuitive approach, it&rsquo;s actually far from practical.

In an ideal world you could swap, bridge and farm all in one transaction from the source chain.</div><img src="images/6500041fe0fcd22fbf3aa69c-650008e5efaa1fc992bbe28c_44126f3f922c1e8e16e39f8e5680213c.jpg" loading="lazy" alt=""><div>Introducing Stargate, the <strong>first</strong> and <strong>only</strong> bridge to solve the Bridging Trilemma, unlocking seamless composability; enabling the wrapping of all existing DeFi applications.
